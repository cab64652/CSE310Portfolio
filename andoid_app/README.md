# Overview

This app is a flash card app. The plan was to make so that users could input their own flash cards and even make different sets of flash cards however I ran into a lot of issues with Android Studio. While I was working on the app it started giving me API errors and I was not able to get them resolved. However before the app stopped working all I had completed was making a single flash card switch between question and answer. It was when I was starting to set up multiple flash cards tha it quit working and after that nothing I did would get it to work. 

I created this project to gain more practice with Java and to learn Android Studio.
