# Overview

The object of this game this game is earn as many points as possible by collecting the flag and maneuvering around the board avoiding being touched by the bot. The player moves around using the mouse to click on point for the player to move to. The player starts in the home base which is a safe area where you cannot be touched by the bot. If the player is touched by the bot 5 points are subtracted from the player's score. Once the player has collected the flag the player will earn 1 point per second. If the player has the flag and is touched by the bot 5 points are subtracted from the score, the flag is returned to the starting position, and the player is returned to the home base. The player may return to the home base at anytime to avoid being touched by the bot however if the player is holding the flag and returns to the home base the flag will be returned to the starting position.
