# Overview



{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Rust language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

- Fix the overflow error so that this program can handle large messages.
- Using a better encryption algorithm that wold be more secure.
- Make it so all the characters on the keyboard are usable. 
- Make it so it could encrypt more than just inputted messages.
